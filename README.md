# Artificial-Neural-Network :space_invader:
An attempt to make an artificial neural network from scratch in JS...

/!\ This repo contains some notes / code / test but it's only a way for me to keep my knowage somewhere and maybe helps some of you to get nice learning resources as I update the [Knowage sources section of that README](#anchors-in-markdown) as I read / watch new stuff of the subject. If you are looking for fully fonctional / ready to use NN I encourage you to see libs like [Synaptic](http://caza.la/synaptic/#/) [ConvNetJS](https://github.com/karpathy/convnetjs) [deeplearn.js](https://deeplearnjs.org/) /!\
