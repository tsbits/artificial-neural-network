# Artificial-Neural-Network :space_invader:
An attempt to make an artificial neural network from scratch in JS...

/!\ This repo contains some notes / code / draft but it's only a way for me to keep my knowage somewhere and maybe helps some of you to get nice learning resources as I update the [Knowage sources section of that README](#knowage-sources-book) as I read / watch new stuff of the subject. All the link contains ressources in english, except these with a small french flag that are in french... If you are looking for fully fonctional / ready to use NN I encourage you to see libs like [Synaptic](http://caza.la/synaptic/#/) [ConvNetJS](https://github.com/karpathy/convnetjs) [deeplearn.js](https://deeplearnjs.org/) /!\  

# Code :computer:
In the _code directory there is some...code that I wrote will learning stuff. The [_nnNodeStarter](_code/_nnNodeStarter) folder is a basic package I duplicate each time I start to code an exemple. It's juste a simple NodeJS program that run in the shell and allow me to test stuff. 

All the folders in [_code](_code/) prefixed by "CLDL" are exemple I tryed to make from the book ["Comprendre le Deep Learning: Une introduction aux réseaux de neurones"](https://www.amazon.fr/gp/product/B01MSFLMFD/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o01_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1) by Jean-Claude Heudin :fr:
